manim_hkn
=========
[manim Community Version](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html#) wrapper package abstracting various Circuit Elements for animation of HKN ECE educational videos. These elements are built on top of the manim community version, and all inherit from the manim `VMobject` type. To build animations, refer to the [manim Community Tutorials and Guides](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials_guides.html) page, to learn how to build manim animations. The objects defined in this package are `VMobject`s, and can be integrated as such.
